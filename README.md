Hi there! I'm Ali, an indie full-stack developer building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All my coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing to solving real-life problems with code.

My technical expertise includes Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and more. Iâ€™m also proficient with tools like VS Code, Jupyter, zsh, HAProxy, Docker, Git, and Jenkins.

Feel free to take a tour of my work on this page.

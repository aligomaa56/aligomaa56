# Hi, I'm Ali Gomaa 👋  

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in **backend development**. I spend my days building systems that keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes.  

## 🚀 My Journey  
My path as a developer took a major turn thanks to [ALX Academy](https://www.alxafrica.com). Its **rigorous 12-month program** of daily projects, challenging tasks, and mindset training completely reshaped how I approach software.  

## 💡 What I Do  
- **Backend Development** – Designing and optimizing scalable systems  
- **Freelance Projects** – Collaborating with clients to create custom solutions  
- **Problem Solving** – [Check out my LeetCode solutions](https://github.com/aligomaa56/leetcode/tree/main/leet)  

## 🛠️ My Passion  
I love diving deep into the details of software—**understanding how everything works under the hood** rather than just running it. Whether it's debugging an obscure issue or optimizing system performance, I enjoy the process of making things **work efficiently**.  

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me **chasing new ideas** and embracing the **quirky, offbeat side of programming**. Every once in a while, a sudden flash of insight turns even the toughest challenges into fun puzzles to solve.  

📬 **Let's Connect!**  
Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to discussing new ideas, tech, and all things backend!
